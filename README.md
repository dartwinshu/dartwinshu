Hi there! I am Dartwin, a data science enthusiast from Indonesia with background of engineering in Bandung Institute of Technology. I am always excited and hungry for the new knowledge and new skills, especially which can support me in work and can make this world better.

Several areas I'm currently focusing on and learning on are business strategy, general management and data science (data analysis) in several industries.

If you think we share the same interest or vision, you need some of my opinions or help, or look for some collaborations, please do not hesitate to let me know!
